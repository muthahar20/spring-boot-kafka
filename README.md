# spring-boot-kafka

Spring boot kafka application with multiple Producers and multiple Consumers for String data and JSON object - This project explains How to publish message in kafka Topic and consume a message from Kafka Topic. Here message is in String and Json Object format.
In this application there are two publishers, i.e. one for String data and another one is for publishing object. For those two publishers, two KafkaTemplates are used.
To consume those messages and objects two consumers are used. Two KafkaListners are used to consume respective data.

Prerequisites: Java, Sprong Boot, Kafka and Zookeeper

ZooKeeper Framework Installation
Download ZooKeeper
--------------------
download the latest version of ZooKeeper. http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html

Extract the tar file using the following commands âˆ’
$ cd opt/
$ tar -zxf zookeeper-3.4.6.tar.gz
$ cd zookeeper-3.4.6
$ mkdir data

Create configuration file
Open the configuration file named conf/zoo.cfg using the command vi conf/zoo.cfg and all the following parameters to set as starting point.

$ vi conf/zoo.cfg

tickTime = 2000
dataDir = /path/to/zookeeper/data
clientPort = 2181
initLimit = 5
syncLimit = 2

:wq  --> save file on Vi Editor

Once the configuration file has been saved successfully, return to the terminal again. You can now start the zookeeper server.
Start ZooKeeper server:
$ bin/zkServer.sh start

Start CLI
$ bin/zkCli.sh

After typing the above command, you will be connected to the ZooKeeper server and you should get the following response.
Connecting to localhost:2181
